# matplotlib-pharmaceuticals

Hi there! This is my Module 5 Challenge for Rice University's Data Visualization Bootcamp. In this challenge, I am working with Python Pandas and Matplotlib to clean, sort, and analyze data from a pharmaceutical trial of various drug regimens on mice as test subjects.

My analysis is contained within my code to explain the findings and purpose of each section. The code was written in Python but can be implemented in Jupyter notebooks as well, although it may need adjusting if you choose to use Jupyter.

The code and opinions contained herein is mine and mine alone.

Thank you!
